[Monogon](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=26987) - Entry for Ludum Dare 28

Platformer block-placing fun. WASD/Space to move, point and click to place a block; get to the end of the level without falling off the world or landing on spikes. 

Created with LibGDX, Photoshop, and sfxr (also wolfram tones if the music suddenly decides to work...the game is currently sans tunes). Currently executable .jar is the only format available, sorry if java gives you any trouble... 

Hope you enjoy, thank you for taking a look!
